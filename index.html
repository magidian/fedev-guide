        <ul>
            <li>Why (purpose)</li>
            <p>once you become a talented frontend developer, you don't have to worry about money (very good career financially. More fun than pure backend since you work on many different aspects of the product - design, performance, code, colors, typography, UX, serverless. Frontend devs also work on what is used to be done by "pure" backend devs. Exponential room for growth (easier to get into, harder to master)</p>
            <li>CS Fundamentals</li>
            <p>what CS is, how computer works, compiling, abstracting, bigO, efficiency, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, history of CS</p>
            <li>Prep</li>
            <p>all the technologies used in the industry. what CS is, what software development is, what web development is, and the differences between all of them. How the web works, what is http, server, client, their relationships</p>
            <li>HTML, CSS</li>
            <p>5% html, 95% css. Best resources: MDN docs and books. You might waste time searching for tutorials on youtube (make sure the resource is not wasting your time if it's free. Better to go for paid if you can afford it.</p>
            <p>How? --> Learn the basics from a book or google, go to your fav websites (reddit, dribble), curate all the micro-components that you like from these sites, layouts, positioning, flexbox, grid, box model, specificity, start building, repeat</p>
            <p>build different versions of navbar like 100 times, build forms, just keep building the most common things on a website</p>
            <p>responsive design, fluid design, media queries / typography, fluid typography, responsive typography / css is easy to get started. difficult to master / learn it slow. learn it well. If you go fast, you'll crash.</p>
            <p>When to move on? --> you have build over at least a dozen micro-components without JS / you have build at least 5-10 single and multipage websites / you are comfortable with css Fundamentals, positioning, flexbox, grid, media queries etc / it should take you no more than 15 min to make a simple navbar that collapses responsively in mobile and tablet. ABB - Always Be Building</p>
            <li>Git. Github. Command Line Interface</li>
            <p>practice with git, github and CLI when building projects. And keep pushing to github. Best way to keep record of your learning.</p>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <p>Uses - functionality, interactivity, form submissions, buttons, advanced animations, logic, games</p>
            <p>Best resources: youtube, books (eloquent js, ydkjs), MDN docs</p>
            <p>*2 things* solve algorithmic challenges (most people avoid this, but this will help tremendously and will teach you how to think like a programmer. AND build projects (algorithmic challenges will help with the logic when it comes to builiding projects)</p>
            <p>dont' quit; you need to sit with the problem longer. fall in love with the pain.</p>
            <p>Fundamentals - data types, conditionals, functions, logic, objects etc / build common micro-components like modal, lists (todos), navbar hamburger, slides, gallery, side navbar, form logic / ajax, promises, async await, es6 / prototypical inheritance, OOP, difference between them / pure functions, functional programming, design patterns / go through a book</p>
            <p>Design Patterns - don't touch any frameworks. Build at least 10 projects using pure JS. Learn about (Constructor, Module, Prototype, Factory, Observer, Facade, Adapter etc) and why they're important.</p>
            <p>Checklist - build at least 8-10 micro projects. solve at least 50-100 programming algorithms (easy to intermediate). understand JS Fundamentals well. Learn webpack at some point.</p>
            <li>NodeJS</li>
            <p>JS runtime, not a language/framework/library. This allows you to write JS outside of the browser which means you can do much more than just create web apps</p>
            <p>JS is a language (written in a file with the extension ".js"). But you need a web browser to understand and run that code. A web browser contains a "runtime" environment which includes a program (v8 engine) which inclues an interpreter that can understand and execute your ".js" file</p>
            <p>NodeJS is just a program that also contains a "runtime" environment with the v8 engine. But this time, this "runtime" environment has extra features added that allows it to be understood outside of just the browser. (computer, ipad, phone, robots, machinery etc) --> a playground where JS is acceptable</p>
            <p>being a great frontend dev means learning the fundamentals of backend or server-side programming. Dynamic Data allows you to build more "advanced" websites with custom data stored in a database in a server. (blogs, facebook likes, comments, videos)</p>
            <p>How? --> Learn how to build APIs / know the diff between API vs REST API / MDN docs, youtube crash courses, blog tutorials / express, databases (mongo) / a todo list with a database so it doesn't disappear upon refresh / blog, build anything that takes data from front-end and stores data in the backend</p>
            <li>React</li>
            <p>Helps you build JS applications faster. More scalable and maintainable. Learn the WHY (why we use frameworks)</p>
            <p>Flow - if React.js seems hard, it's your JS problem. You should feel excited while learning react.js</p>
            <p>State and UI - one of the main reasons why we use these modern frameworks is because keeping the state (your data) in sync with UI (your view) is very hard, especially as your app grows. For this, if you use pure JS, you have to use specific proven design patterns to build applications for scalability and maintainability long term.</p>
            <p>Build - everything you have build with pure JS thus far, implement all of them with react. Learn Redux.</p>
            <li>Apply for jobs (even slightly before you are ready; learn from interviews)</li>
            <p>Document your journey - blogs on what you learnt (recruiters can contact you from blogs)</p>
            <p>Portfolio is your biggest asset. Design matters (go to sites like behance, dribble and look at phenomenal designs by great UX designers and up you "eye-4-design". Confidence is a memory of working hard and winning; have massive work under your belt.</p>
            <p>Github can be used as your resume - be active on github</p>
            <p>Case studies of one or two of your projects where you talk about what you learned, the journey, the obstacles, cool things you tried etc. Tell a story.</p>
            <p>Job guarantee process(Brute Force Method) - apply to at least 5 jobs every day (150 in a month). Even if you convert at 1%, that's still 1.5 jobs. Most people don't apply enough. Don't worry about not qualifying. Still apply as long as it's somewhat similar. You can learn things quickly. </p>
            <p>Dream job process(Sophisticated Monkey method) - select 3-5 companies you would love to work for. Learn about them, profile them. Send a direct message/personalized email to them. What can you do to stand out? Be more personal. More human.</p>
            <li>Solidify, Explore</li>
            <p>polish your understandings of CSS and JS / learn SASS and BEM / build larger React/Redux projects / security, performance, SSR / serverless is the future - GatsbyJS / Learn a new language like clojure, scheme or c++ / learn and build things that excite you</p>
